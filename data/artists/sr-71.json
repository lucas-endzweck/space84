    "bio": "Formed in Baltimore, MD, United States in 1998, SR-71 has produced three major-label albums: Now You See Inside, Tomorrow, and Here We Go Again.\n\nAfter becoming instant Top 40 material with their driving hit Right Now and the lesser-known Politically Correct on their first album, the band slowly shied from the limelight for its second album, part of the reason the third album was not released in the US.\n\nIn recent days lead singer Mitch Allan has pursued a solo career, reworking some SR-71 songs and creating some of his own. SR-71 split in 2007, but reformed in 2009.\n\nThe name of the band came from SR-71 Blackbird, a retired supersonic surveillance aircraft of the United States Air Force.\n\nCurrent Members:\n    * Mitch Allan - lead vocals, guitar\n    * Pat DeMent - guitar, backing vocals\n    * Mike Ruocco - bass, backing vocals\n    * John Allen - drums, percussion, backing vocals\n\nFormer members:\n    * Dan Garvin - drums, percussion, backing vocals (1998–2001)\n    * Mark Beauchemin - guitar, keyboards, backing vocals (1998–2003)\n    * Jeff Reid - bass, keyboards, backing vocals (1998–2003)",
