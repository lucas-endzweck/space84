    "bio": "Epik High (Hangul: 에픽하이) is a South Korean hip hop group from Seoul, South Korea. The group is composed of Tablo, Mithra Jin and DJ Tukutz.\n\nEpik High was relatively unknown to Koreans in the beginning of its career due to hip-hop music's lack of popularity in Korea. Their success began with the release of their second album, titled \"High Society\". Upon the success of their third album, \"Swan Songs\", released in late 2005, Epik High has become one of the most popular hip-hop figures in Korea. \"Fly\", the title song, and \"Paris\" (feat. Jisun from Loveholic) from their third album became hits in Korea, reaching number one on many Korean music channels as well as on online music charts.[1] \"Fly\" was also chosen for the video games FIFA 07 and Pump it up , this song has now become a popular track for dancers/freestylers. Epik High's fourth album, \"Remapping the Human Soul\", released in January 23, 2007 has shown a very different music style from their previous albums. \"Fan\", the fourth album's title song, and \"Love Love Love\" have been big hits in 2007."
