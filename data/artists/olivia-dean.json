    "bio": "Born and raised in Walthamstow, Olivia Dean’s career officially took flight when she uploaded demos onto Soundcloud in 2018 – eventually securing her a deal with the London-based indie label AMF. Her debut EP, OK Love You Bye, released in November, provided the perfect introduction to her talents: a raw, vintage soulful sound, with echoes of Amy Winehouse and Angie Stone, combined with lyrics that navigate the human heart with searing precision.",
