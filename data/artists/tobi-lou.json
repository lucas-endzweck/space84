He initially pursued a career in professional baseball but injuries led him back home and eventually to Los Angeles, California. In the city of angels, the young artist developed his signature upbeat sound while honing his visual branding along-side Glassface and Goodnight Meesh. With his buoyant music and visual content, Tobi Lou is creating his own magical universe full of enchanting cartoon characters and vibrant animation.",
