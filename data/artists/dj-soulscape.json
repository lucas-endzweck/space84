    "bio": "If a single artist represents 'The Sound Of Seoul', it is DJ Soulscape. A vinyl archeologist who excavates rare, indigenous beats, he delivers a groovy bi-bim-bop mix of old school Korean rock, soul, disco, and boogaloo served sizzling hot in a funky, fresh hip-hop style. A favorite among clubbers and critics alike, DJ Soulscape has been nominated as the Crossover Artist of the Year at the Korea Music Awards (2003) and honored as the creative genius behind one of the top 100 K-Pop Albums of the 20th Century (2008). In between his gigs as a producer and performer, he also moonlights as one of Seoul's top party promoters, music columnists, and radio show hosts. (INTERNATIONAL WEBSITE : www.djsoulscape.kr)"
