He began his music career in 2016 when he started writing, singing, and recording his own music as a freshman at Indiana University, releasing his debut single \"Fall For You,\" with friend and producer Triegy.\n\nIn November 2016, \"Fall For You\" charted on the United States Viral 50 Chart on Spotify.[1] Following the release, the duo released a string of four singles.\n\nWith his growing success, French traveled to Los Angeles to work with grammy-nominated producer Dru Decaro, together creating French’s solo singles ‘love ride,' ‘superstars,’ 'sweet home,' 'hearts of gold,' and French's latest 'someone new.'
