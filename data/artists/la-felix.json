    "bio": "La Felix is a Funk/Nu Disco artist currently based in Auckland, New Zealand. Unlike most millenials, music was not readily available to him on the internet, instead Felix was a “crate digger”. \n\nHe discovered his music by sifting through his mother’s huge vinyl collection. Vinyls ranging from the Jazz and Blues eras, to the Classical, Baroque, and Romantic periods captivated his creativity. Felix attributes his genre melding melody writing to the diversity he found in those crates.\n\nWith a little Daft Punk tune, but above all a lot of audacity and talent, New Zealand producer La Felix presents Be with You Tonight. The young producer allows himself other influences like Breakbot, Justice or Michael Jackson to create his own disco-electro-pop."
