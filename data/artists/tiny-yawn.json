    "bio": "Tiny Yawn, stylized as \"tiny yawn,\" is a Tokyo-based four-piece band from Japan. The band was formed in May 2017 when Megumi Takahashi (vocals and keyboard), Yuki Sugama (guitar), and Kohei Takashima (drums) joined forces with Koji Yasuda (bass), who came from a different band.\n\nTheir musical style incorporates elements of 90s music, emo, post-rock, and neo-soul. In 2019, they gained recognition by winning the RO JACK competition for the ROCK IN JAPAN FESTIVAL. They also had the opportunity to perform at the \"Ringo Music Festival\" in Matsumoto City, Nagano Prefecture during the same year. Further solidifying their rising status, they were selected to perform at JAPAN JAM in 2020, garnering attention as an emerging band.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the band had more time to explore a variety of music genres. They expressed their desire to incorporate these newfound influences into their future output, aiming to showcase a broader range as a band in the coming years.",
