    "bio": "羊文学 (Hitsujibungaku, literally translated to \"Sheep Literature\") is an indie rock trio formed in 2012 in Tokyo, Japan. The band consists of Moeka Shiotsuka (Vo, Gt), Yurika Kawanishi (Ba), and Hiroa Fukuda (Dr). Former members of the band are the drummer Shino (left in October 2015)  and Wow ( left in December 2016) in charge of bass and chorus.\n\nShiozuka replied in an interview that it would be cool if the word \"sheep\" was included in both English and Japanese, and that \"literature\" was connected to express a big world view that is not limited to music by name. In another interview, she named it \"sheep\" because she likes the band S.R.S who used sheep for album artwork, and said that \"literature\" was good because he wanted to express a feeling like Sigur Rós."
