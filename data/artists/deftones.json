    "bio": "Deftones is an American metal band from Sacramento, California, formed in 1988, consisting of Chino Moreno (lead vocals and guitar), Stephen Carpenter (guitar), Frank Delgado (keyboards and turntables), and Abe Cunningham (drums and percussion). Vega (formerly of Quicksand) took on bass duties from mid-2009 to ca. 2021 in substitution for Chi Cheng, who was seriously injured in an automobile accident in Santa Clara, California on November 4, 2008. Cheng remained in a coma until his death on April 13, 2013, due to cardiac arrest. Fred Sablan is their current live bassist starting in 2022. Lance Jackman plays guitar during non-US shows since Stephen Carpenter no longer travels abroad as of 2022.\n\nWhile they were mostly an alternative metal band in their early years, their sound changed into something more complex and experimental in 2000, as a result, they are often coined today as an alternative rock band. \n\nCritics have often praised them as one of the closest to unique rock bands of recent years for their innovative, atmospheric music; as Johnny Loftus writes, \"Rock critics usually reserve a special place for Deftones above or at least away from the rest of the turn-of-the-century metal movement [...] Deftones have always seemed more curious, more willing to incorporate traditionally revered sounds like dream pop and DC hardcore into their Northern California alt-metal.\"\n\nFrontman Chino Moreno’s poetic lyrics—described by a Time magazine critic as “fiercely intelligent”—are often evocative, yet are sparse enough to allow for multiple interpretations. Moreno has cited Morrissey, Weezer’s Rivers Cuomo, The Cure’s Robert Smith, and Depeche Mode’s David Gahan among his favorite singers, and beyond an occasional similarity in vocal technique, these singers’ sweeping sense of drama and delicate vulnerability is often evident in Moreno’s vocals.\n\nDeftones members have worked on several side projects, including Moreno’s Team Sleep and drummer Abe Cunningam’s Phallucy. Guitarist Stephen Carpenter works with a group called Kush, featuring members of Fear Factory and Cypress Hill. Turntablist Frank Delgado has a DJ crew with DJ Crook of Team Sleep, DJ Julez, and Matt D called Decibel Devils.\n\n* Chino Moreno (vocals, guitar)\n* Stephen Carpenter (guitar)\n* Abe Cunningham (drums)\n* Chi Cheng (bass, backing vocals)\n* Frank Delgado (turntablist/keyboardist/sampler)\n\n(Carpenter is generally credited with “strings”, this title is used to refer to when Carpenter uses a distorted 5 string bass guitar most noticeably on the tracks \"Needles and Pins\" and \"Beware\")\n\nReleases:\n\n1992 - like linus (demo)\n1995 - Adrenaline\n1997 - Around the Fur\n2000 - White Pony\n2002 - Music in High Places: Deftones - Live In Hawaii (DVD)\n2002 - Back to School (Mini Maggit) (EP)\n2003 - Deftones\n2004 - Deftones extended-release for Tokyo Dome LIVE\n2005 - B-Sides & Rarities (with accompanying DVD video library and live footage)\n2006 - Saturday Night Wrist\n2009 - Eros ( Shelved)\n2010 - Diamond Eyes \n2011 - Covers\n2012 - Koi No Yokan\n2016 - Gore\n2020 - Ohms\n2020 - Black Stallion (White Pony Remix)\n2025 - Private music (22 August 2025)",
