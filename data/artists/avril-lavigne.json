    "bio": "Avril Ramona Lavigne (born September 27, 1984) is a Canadian singer and songwriter. At age 16, she signed a two-album recording contract with Arista Records. Her debut studio album, Let Go (2002), is the best-selling album of the 21st century by a Canadian artist. It yielded the singles \"Complicated\" and \"Sk8er Boi\", which emphasized a skate punk persona and earned her the title \"Pop Punk Queen\" from music publications. She is considered a key musician in the development of pop punk music since she paved the way for female-driven, punk-influenced pop music in the early 2000s. Her second studio album, Under My Skin (2004), became Lavigne's first album to reach the top of the Billboard 200 chart in the United States, going on to sell 10 million copies worldwide.\n\nLavigne's third studio album, The Best Damn Thing (2007), reached number one in seven countries worldwide and saw the international success of its lead single \"Girlfriend\", which became her first single to reach the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. Her next two studio albums, Goodbye Lullaby (2011) and Avril Lavigne (2013), saw continued commercial success and were both certified gold in Canada, the United States, and other territories. After releasing her sixth studio album, Head Above Water (2019), she returned to her punk roots with her seventh studio album, Love Sux (2022).\n\nAlongside her music career, Lavigne voiced an animated character in the film Over the Hedge (2006) and made her screen acting debut in Fast Food Nation (2006). Her accolades include eight Grammy Awards nominations.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avril_Lavigne\n\nStudio albums\nLet Go (2002)\nUnder My Skin (2004)\nThe Best Damn Thing (2007)\nGoodbye Lullaby (2011)\nAvril Lavigne (2013)\nHead Above Water (2019)\nLove Sux (2022)",
