    "bio": "Friday Night Plans is the Tokyo-based band consisting of singer-songwriter Masumi and a revolving cast of collaborators that usually includes producer and drummer Tepppei. Friday Night Plans found some considerable success last year with their ultra smooth cover of Japanese City Pop' \"Plastic Love\", but it seems their sound has evolved immeasurably since then.\n\nAfter recently releasing \"All The Dots\" and \"Decoy\", Masumi and co. are now releasing the new Friday Night Plans EP, Complex. A stunning and eclectic collection, nothing is off limits. Their inviting brand of late night R&B takes its cues from all over the world, from jazz and soul to K-Pop and Justin Bieber, with surprisingly cohesive results. All their disparate influences sit side-by-side, with wildly experimental electronics drawing those threads together."
